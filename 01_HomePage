                My name is Christina Summa, and I am in the final year of my undergraduate studies at Oakland University. As the end of my academic journey approaches, I eagerly anticipate my graduation this December. Alongside my studies, I have been dedicated to my full-time role in the IT department of a prominent CPA firm. This professional experience has not only broadened my knowledge but also honed my skills in the field of information technology.

                My time at Oakland University has been a valuable chapter in my life, allowing me to delve into my academic interests and grow as an individual. Through coursework and extracurricular activities, I have developed a strong foundation in computer science and related disciplines, which has prepared me for the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.

                Beyond my academic and professional pursuits, I am an enthusiastic learner and a passionate advocate for continuous self-improvement. I believe in embracing each day with a positive attitude, as reflected in my favorite quote: 'Why worry about tomorrow; let tomorrow worry for itself; let today's own trouble suffice for the day.' This mantra reminds me to focus on the present moment, make the most of every opportunity, and maintain a healthy work-life balance.
